Unit Tests:
	ASCIIImportTest:
		Test Case: Valid ASCII Configuration
			Test Cases: File with headers
				Test Case: Valid data in file
					- Valid number of headers
					- Valid number of rows 
					- Valid number of samples
					- Valid timestamps
				Test Cases: Invalid data in file
					Test Cases: Invalid column delimiter 	
						1. Column delimiter the same as number delimiter
							- throw exception ( invalid number of samples)
						2. Column delimiter the same as delimiter in date time format
							- throw exception ( invalid number of samples)
					Test Cases: Number of headers not the same as number samples in row
						1. Number of headers less than number of samples in row 
							- generate missing headers
						2. Number of headers greater than number of samples in row
							- generate missing samples (NaN)
					Test Case: Invalid sample format
						- set sample as NaN
					Test Case: Invalid Timestamp
						- skip whole row or throw exception (whole data file invalid)
					Test Case: Empty or whitespaces in row
						- skip row
			Test Case: File without headers
				- generate headers based on first row
				- skip excess cells if there are more than the first row
				- add missing cells as NaN if there are less then first row
		Test Case: Invalid ASCII Configuration
			Test Case: Column delimiter the same as number delimiter or date time format delimiter
				- throw exception
			Test Case: File does not exist
				- throw exception
